# Arkanoid

A C++ game engine experiment using SFML. 
Arkanoid is used as a proof-of-concept game for developing the engine.
Binary assets used in this project are in a separate repository: https://github.com/HannoCombrinck/ArkanoidData.

This is a work-in-progress and there isn't a working application ready yet.
